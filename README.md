# tumblrcrawl

A simple script to download images and videos from a Tumblr site. Requires aria2c and youtube-dl.

```
tumblrcrawl.py <sitename> [months]
```

sitename is required of course and there's an optional argument to limit how many months back to retrieve posts.  Video will also be grabbed from YouTube, Vimeo and Instagram.
