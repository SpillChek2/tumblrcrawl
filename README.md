# tumblrcrawl

A simple script to download images and videos from a Tumblr site. Requires aria2c.

```
tumblrcrawl.py <sitename> [months]
```

sitename is required of course and there's an optional argument to limit how many months back to retrieve posts. Not including this will retrieve the entire Tumblr.
